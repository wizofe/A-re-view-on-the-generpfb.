Resuscitation of&nbsp;<i>MTb</i>&nbsp;is crucial to the aetiology of Tuberculosis, not only because latent tuberculosis is estimated to affect one-third of the world population<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ruggiero_2009}</cite>. Kapoor et all, showed&nbsp;that the resuscitation-promoting factor&nbsp;<i>RpfB</i> is mainly responsible for&nbsp;<i>MTb</i> resuscitation from dormancy<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kapoor_2013}</cite>. Given the impact of latent Tuberculosis,&nbsp;<i>RpfB</i> represents an interesting target for tuberculosis drug discovery. Currently, no molecular models of substrate binding and catalysis are hitherto available for this enzyme.</div><div></div><div>As described in the concept of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology by Sir Francis Crick<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{CRICK_1970}</cite>, this is the one-way process where each gene in the DNA molecule carries the information needed to construct one protein, which, acting as an enzyme, controls one chemical reaction in the cell. This coursework is structured based on the above mentioned idea.</div><h3 data-label="509471" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="509471" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><b>KEYWORDS</b></h3><div>rpfb; tuberculosis; sequence analysis; cell wall</div><h1 data-label="507127" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="507127" class="ltx_title_section">Results&nbsp;</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="504372" class="ltx_title_subsection">General Genome Features</h2><div>RpfB gene is located in the forward strand of the MTb chromosome in the location 1,128,091-1,129,179, with a length of 1089 bp.
