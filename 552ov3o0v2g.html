<div>Given the fact that a match with -10 and -35 promoter sequences, while lacking an ORF may encode a functional RNA (tRNA, rRNA, etc), it is valuable to try and locate those promoters. From the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, which has a promoter prediction algorithm, it seems that a quite possible promoter lies in the position&nbsp;524-569 upstream</div><div></div><blockquote><div>AGGTGGTTGAGTGTTGCCGAGGTCGGGGATATAGCGCGTTGACTCTACTT</div></blockquote><div>The ORF, including this promoter, can also be part of an operon, meaning that it will be regulated along with other genes and may be functionally related to them as well. Finally, as those sequences are used under different conditions in the cell, there may be binding sites for repressor or activator proteins that are involved in regulating many different genes in the bacterial cell. In fact, considering that the promoter lies in the position between 524-569 upstream and there's an ORF at the same position with a -10 promoter 'TATA', there is really possible that the annotation of the protein is misplaced: the beginning of the coding sequence, in that case, includes 75 nucleotides upstream the originally annotated start codon. The starting codon would be a 'GTG'. It is indeed more usual the starting codon to be 'ATG' but there has been about 15% of the cases in E. Coli bacterium that this is a 'GTG'.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
