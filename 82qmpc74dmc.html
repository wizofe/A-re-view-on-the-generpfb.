<div>Considering the cellular location of the gene, it can be assumed, after running a motif search via Expasy (with the resulted motif "MLRL-----------VVGALLLVLAFAGGYAVAAC"), that it lies to the subcellular position of this protein to be the: Prokaryotic membrane and the&nbsp;lipoprotein lipid attachment site.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="920892" class="ltx_title_subsection">Protein</h2><div>To discover the conserved protein domains of the protein, I used NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). The protein is characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be shown by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div>
