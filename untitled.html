<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div><i>Rpfb</i> is a gene responsible for the creation of the protein&nbsp;<i>Resuscitation-promoting factor&nbsp;</i>i. Resuscitation of <i>Mtb</i> is crucial to the etiology of Tuberculosis, because latent tuberculosis is estimated to affect one-third of the world population. The resuscitation-promoting factor RpfB is mainly responsible for Mtb resuscitation from dormancy. Given the impact of latent Tuberculosis, RpfB represents an interesting target for tuberculosis drug discovery. However, no molecular models of substrate binding and catalysis are hitherto available for this enzyme.</div><div></div>
