<div>Finally, using the CATH database, I acquired the 11 domains that are most relevant to the protein.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sillitoe_2015}</cite></div><div>The domains are the following belonging the cluster 2.20.230.10.1.1.1</div><blockquote><div>4fuoA01</div><div>4funA01</div><div>4fum01</div><div>4fupA01</div><div>4fuoB01</div></blockquote><div>as well as the cluster 2.20.230.10.3.1.1.1</div><blockquote><div>4fzqD00</div><div>4fzqF00</div><div>4fzqB00</div><div>4fzqA00</div><div>4fzqE00</div><div>4fzCD00</div></blockquote><div>With limited space and time, it makes more sense to concentrate on the two that have the highest sequence similarity, i.e.&nbsp;4fupA01, 4fupB01.&nbsp; Those two superfamilies adopt the fold members of Hydrolases (98.4%), with the architecture described as "Single Sheet". The functional family of this CATH domain is described as Accumulation associated protein and more specifically as a membrane protein, as can be gathered by the PDBSum link provided by the CATH entry (PDB id:&nbsp;</div><div>  &nbsp;<table><tbody><tr><td>   &nbsp;    &nbsp;           &nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Conrady_2012}</cite></div><h1></h1><h1>License</h1><div></div><div>Â© 2018 Ioannis Valasakis.
