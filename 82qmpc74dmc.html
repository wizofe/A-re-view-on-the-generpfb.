The protein characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be assumed by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In the literature, the protein is described as a factor that stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Has peptidoglycan (<i>PG</i>) hydrolytic activity. Active in the pM concentration range. Has little to no effect on actively-growing cells. <i>PG</i> fragments could either directly activate the resuscitation pathway of dormant bacteria or serve as a substrate for endogenous Rpf, resulting in low molecular weight products with resuscitation activity. A fragment (residues 194-362) hydrolyzes an artificial lysozyme substrate, by itself has little activity on the cell wall, in combination with <i>RipA</i> is active against cell wall extracts from a number of Actinobacteria; this activity is inhibited by <i>PBP1A</i> (<i>ponA1</i>). Sequential gene disruption indicates <i>RpfB</i> and RpfE are higher than <i class="">RpfD</i> and <i>RpfC</i> in the functional hierarchy. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lee_2014,Chauviac_2014,Bhuwan_2016,Ruggiero_2013}</cite></div><div></div><div>Using HHBlits.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Zimmermann_2017}</cite></div><div></div><div>There is substantial evidence that the protein is strongly correlated to its adjacent proteins, forming one group of inter-related behaviour.
