<div>The purpose of this courseworis to provide computational research information on&nbsp;<i>rpfb</i>, a gene in the&nbsp;<i>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTb)</i>. It is also known by its ID:&nbsp;<i>RV1009</i>. The approach is going to be methodological, as discussed in&nbsp;Sequence Analysis lectures. Computational Software, Online Databases and Web Services like Protein BLAST,&nbsp; HHBlits and InterPro are utilised to retrieve the required information in order to generate further insights.</div>
