<div>Considering the cellular location of the gene, it can be assumed, after getting the following motif result via Expasy:</div><div></div><blockquote><div>MLRL-----------VVGALLLVLAFAGGYAVAAC</div></blockquote><div>that is the subcellular position of this protein in the prokaryotic membrane and the&nbsp;lipoprotein lipid attachment site.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="920892" class="ltx_title_subsection">Protein</h2><div>To discover the conserved protein domains of the protein, I used NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). The protein is characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be assumed by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Using HHBlits pira ta arxidia.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Zimmermann_2017}</cite></div><div></div><div>There is strong evidence that the protein is strongly related with it's adjacent proteins</div>
