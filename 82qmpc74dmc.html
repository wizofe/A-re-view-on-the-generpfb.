The protein characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be assumed by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Using HHBlits pira ta arxidia.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Zimmermann_2017}</cite></div><div></div><div>There is strong evidence that the protein is strongly correlated to its adjacent proteins, forming one group of inter-related behaviour.
