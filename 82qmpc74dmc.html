The protein characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be assumed by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In the literature the protein is described asFactor that stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Has peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolytic activity. Active in the pM concentration range. Has little to no effect on actively-growing cells. PG fragments could either directly activate the resuscitation pathway of dormant bacteria or serve as a substrate for endogenous Rpf, resulting in low molecular weight products with resuscitation activity.</div><div></div><div>Using HHBlits.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Zimmermann_2017}</cite></div><div></div><div>There is substantial evidence that the protein is strongly correlated to its adjacent proteins, forming one group of inter-related behaviour.
