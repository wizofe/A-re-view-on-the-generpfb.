<div>This&nbsp;coursework will provide computational research information on <i>RpfB</i>, a gene in the&nbsp;<i>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTb)</i>. It is also known as&nbsp;<i>RV1009</i>. The approach is going to be methodological, as discussed in&nbsp;Sequence Analysis lectures. Computational Software, Online Databases and Web Services like Protein BLAST,&nbsp; HHBlits and InterPro are utilised to retrieve the required information to generate further insights.&nbsp;</div>
