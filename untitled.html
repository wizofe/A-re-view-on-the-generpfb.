<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div><i>RpfB</i> is a gene responsible for the creation of the protein&nbsp;<i>Resuscitation-promoting factor&nbsp;</i>in the&nbsp;<i>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb)</i>. Resuscitation of&nbsp;<i>Mtb</i> is crucial to the aetiology of Tuberculosis, because latent tuberculosis is estimated to affect one-third of the world population. The resuscitation-promoting factor <i>RpfB</i> is mainly responsible for <i>Mtb</i> resuscitation from dormancy. Given the impact of latent Tuberculosis, <i>RpfB</i> represents an interesting target for tuberculosis drug discovery. However, no molecular models of substrate binding and catalysis are hitherto available for this enzyme.</div><div></div>
