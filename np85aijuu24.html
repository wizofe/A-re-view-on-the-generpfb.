<div></div><h2 data-label="315512" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transcriptional Regulation</h2><div>Protein synthesis is a process that happens in two steps. First, the DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an RNA polymerase complex, and second, the mRNA is translated to protein by a ribosome, which is a complex of proteins and rRNA. Having as a starting point the sequence of the gene&nbsp;<i>RpfB,</i>&nbsp;I was able to analyse it with the&nbsp;<i>Open Reading Frame</i> (<i>ORF</i>) Finder from the NCBI website, to explore further ideas. An ORF is a part of a reading frame with the potential to be translated to mRNA. Specifically, the ORF2 seems to match the rpfB (</div><div></div><div></div>
