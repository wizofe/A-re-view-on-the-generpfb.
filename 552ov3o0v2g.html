<div>Given the fact that a match with -10 and -35 promoter sequences, while lacking an ORF may encode a functional RNA (tRNA, rRNA, etc), it is interesting to try and locate those promoters. From the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, promoter prediction website, it seems that a quite possible promoter lies in the position&nbsp;524-569<sup>AGGTGGTTGAGTGTTGCCGAGGTCGGGGATATAGCGCGTTGACTCTACTT</sup>. The ORF, including this promoter, can also be part of an operon, meaning that it will be regulated along with other genes and may be functionally related to them as well. Finally, as those sequences are used under different conditions&nbsp;</div>
