The protein characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be assumed by using the InterPro protein database.</div><div>lalalal</div>
