Resuscitation of&nbsp;<i>MTb</i>&nbsp;is crucial to the aetiology of Tuberculosis, not only because latent tuberculosis is estimated to affect one-third of the world population. It has been previously shown that the resuscitation-promoting factor&nbsp;<i>RpfB</i> is mainly responsible for&nbsp;<i>MTb</i> resuscitation from dormancy. Given the impact of latent Tuberculosis,&nbsp;<i>RpfB</i> represents an interesting target for tuberculosis drug discovery. However, no molecular models of substrate binding and catalysis are hitherto available for this enzyme.<b>&nbsp;</b>Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to establish a non-replicating state and survive in an intracellular habitat for years. Resuscitation of dormant M. tuberculosis bacteria is promoted by resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs), which are secreted from slowly replicating bacteria close to dormant bacteria.</div><div></div>
