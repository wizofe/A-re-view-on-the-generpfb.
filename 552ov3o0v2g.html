<div>Given the fact that a match with -10 and -35 promoter sequences, while lacking an ORF may encode a functional RNA (tRNA, rRNA, etc), it is interesting to try and locate those promoters. From the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, promoter prediction website, it seems that one quite possible promoter lies in the position&nbsp;&nbsp; 524&nbsp;&nbsp; 569&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGGTGGTTGAGTGTTGCCGAGGTCGGGGATATAGCGCGTTGACTCTACTT </div><div></div>
