<div>Finally, using the CATH database, I acquired the 11 domains that are most relevant to the protein.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sillitoe_2015}</cite></div><div>Some of the domains belong to the cluster 2.20.230.10.1.1.1</div><blockquote><div>4fuoA01</div><div>4funA01</div><div>4fum01</div><div>4fupA01</div><div>4fuoB01</div></blockquote><div>as well as the cluster 2.20.230.10.3.1.1.1</div><blockquote><div>4fzqD00</div><div>4fzqF00</div><div>4fzqB00</div><div>4fzqA00</div><div>4fzqE00</div><div>4fzCD00</div></blockquote><div>With limited space and time, it makes more sense to concentrate on the few that have the highest sequence similarity, i.e.&nbsp;3eo5, 4fupA01,&nbsp;4emn.&nbsp; Those two superfamilies adopt the fold members of Lyases(48%) and Hydrolases (98.4%) respectively. The architecture descriptions are "Orthogonal Bundle" and "Single Sheet". The functional family of this CATH domain is defined as&nbsp;<i>Accumulation associated protein</i> and&nbsp;<i>Hydrophilic</i> (grouped as a membrane protein). This information is available online on the&nbsp; PDBSum link provided by the CATH entry (PDB id: 4fup).<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Conrady_2012}</cite> Similar protein features exist on the&nbsp;<i>Escherichia coli&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Staphylococcus epidermidis&nbsp;</i>(92%) match respectively<i>.&nbsp;</i>There is also another domain, identical to 3eo5 (Lysozyme) namely the 1xsfA00, which is experimentally verified in the CATH database and verifies the Lysozyme prediction made above.</div><div></div><div>Concluding, some Gene Ontology (GO) annotations sequenced by UniProt-GO. These can be summarised as:<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huntley_2014}</cite></div><blockquote><div>protein binding</div><div>extracellular region</div><div>positive regulation of gene expression</div><div>negative regulation of gene expression</div><div>positive regulation of growth rate</div><div>dormancy exit of symbiont in host&nbsp;</div></blockquote><div>Further analysis could prove valuable on getting deeper information about the protein&nbsp;<i>RpfB</i> using the CATH domains, gene ontologies, Gene3D results analysis and HMM predictions.
