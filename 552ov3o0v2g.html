<div>Given the fact that a match with -10 and -35 promoter sequences, while lacking an ORF may encode a functional RNA (tRna, rRNA, etc), it is interesting to t</div><div></div><h2 data-label="920892" class="ltx_title_subsection">Protein</h2><div>To discover the conserved protein domains of the protein, I used NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). The protein is characterised as a resuscitation-promoting factor, which is a cell-wall glycosidase that cleaves cell-wall peptidoglycan; it stimulates resuscitation of dormant cells. Three domains are conserved: YabE,&nbsp;Transglycosylase and G5. Similar results can be shown by using the InterPro protein database.&nbsp;</div>
